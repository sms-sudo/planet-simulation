Rings 
Rings are 270,000 km in diameter, but only a few hundred meters thick. Particles are  centimeters to decameters in size and are ice (some may be covered with ice); there are traces of silicate and carbon minerals. There are four main ring groups and three more faint, narrowring groups separated by gaps called divisions.
